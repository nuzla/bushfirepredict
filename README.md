This research investigates the development of wildfire prediction models using One-Class Classification (OCC) algorithms, aiming to overcome limitations inherent in prior studies that utilized biased or imbalanced datasets for multi-class classification. The study leverages two extensive, heterogeneous datasets from California and Western Australia, each comprising high-resolution environmental features categorized into topography, weather, and plant fuel moisture variables. A comprehensive suite of OCC algorithms—spanning linear, ensemble, proximity-based, probabilistic, and deep neural network-based methods—was employed to construct prediction models. The models achieved mean test accuracy rates ranging from 55% to 97%, with the highest performance observed in deep learning-based OCC models. A key contribution of this work is the comparative evaluation of diverse OCC approaches for wildfire prediction, alongside the identification of dominant predictive features—namely precipitation, elevation, vapour pressure deficit, and dew point temperature—using Shapley value analysis. Our findings underscore the suitability and effectiveness of One-Class Modelling frameworks when applied to real-world, class-imbalanced wildfire datasets, thereby advancing the methodological toolkit for early wildfire detection.
